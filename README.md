- All puzzle logic can go into /controllers/sudoku-solver.js
- The validate function should take a given puzzle string and check it to see if it has 81 valid characters for the input.
- The check functions should be validating against the current state of the board.
- The solve function should handle solving any given valid puzzle string, not just the test inputs and solutions. You are expected to write out the logic to solve this.
- All routing logic can go into /routes/api.js
- See the puzzle-strings.js file in /controllers for some sample puzzles your application should solve
- To run the challenge tests on this page, set NODE_ENV to test without quotes in the .env file
- To run the tests in the console, use the command npm run test. To open the Replit console, press Ctrl+Shift+P (Cmd if on a Mac) and type "open shell"
- Write the following tests in tests/1_unit-tests.js:

- Logic handles a valid puzzle string of 81 characters
- Logic handles a puzzle string with invalid characters (not 1-9 or .)
- Logic handles a puzzle string that is not 81 characters in length
- Logic handles a valid row placement
- Logic handles an invalid row placement
- Logic handles a valid column placement
- Logic handles an invalid column placement
- Logic handles a valid region (3x3 grid) placement
- Logic handles an invalid region (3x3 grid) placement
- Valid puzzle strings pass the solver
- Invalid puzzle strings fail the solver
- Solver returns the expected solution for an incomplete puzzle
- Write the following tests in tests/2_functional-tests.js

- Solve a puzzle with valid puzzle string: POST request to /api/solve
- Solve a puzzle with missing puzzle string: POST request to /api/solve
- Solve a puzzle with invalid characters: POST request to /api/solve
- Solve a puzzle with incorrect length: POST request to /api/solve
- Solve a puzzle that cannot be solved: POST request to /api/solve
- Check a puzzle placement with all fields: POST request to /api/check
- Check a puzzle placement with single placement conflict: POST request to /api/check
- Check a puzzle placement with multiple placement conflicts: POST request to /api/check
- Check a puzzle placement with all placement conflicts: POST request to /api/check
- Check a puzzle placement with missing required fields: POST request to /api/check
- Check a puzzle placement with invalid characters: POST request to /api/check
- Check a puzzle placement with incorrect length: POST request to /api/check
